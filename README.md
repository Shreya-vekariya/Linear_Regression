# Predicting Olympic Medals using Linear Regression

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict the number of medals a country can win in future Olympic Games using a linear regression model. The model is trained on historical data of Olympic teams, including features such as past medal counts, GDP, population, and other relevant factors.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes the following features for each country:
- **Team**: The name of the team
- **Year**: The year of the Olympic Games
- **Athletes**: The count of athletes participating in the Olympic year
- **Event**: No of events in which teams participated
- **Age**: Age of athletes
- **Height**: Height of the athlete
- **Weight**: Weight of the athlete
- **Past Medals**: The number of medals won by the country in previous Olympic Games
- **Medals**: No of predicted medals

The target variable is the **Medals** won by the country in a specific Olympic year.
